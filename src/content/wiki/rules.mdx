This is not a comprehensive list of rules, and the specifics of enforcement are left up to the judgment of staff. There are no loopholes. That being said, this server is not very strict and we are happy to clarify things if needed.

Please be aware they you are free to use any technical mechanics that you wish, such as light suppression, large scale farms, chunk loaders, etc. as long as they do not conflict with any other rules. This does not cover duping in any form.
 
 # Chat rules

 These rules apply to Discord, in-game chat, and voice chat.

## 1. Treat others with respect

You are expected to treat other members of the server with respect and maturity. Insulting or discriminating against people because of their identity, age, nationality, etc. is not allowed under any circumstances. While friendly banter is allowed and good, it should be kept in check.

## 2. Do not post personal information

Do not under any circumstances post the personal information of others. This includes locations, addresses, IPs, ages, etc.

## 3. Avoid discussion of sensitive topics

Please try avoid discussion of sensitive topics, specifically current events regarding wars and politics. 

While we understand that these topics are important, this isn't the best place to have a constructive discussion about them.

## 4. Do not post offensive or NSFW content

Do not post any content that is includes NSFW content (sexually explicit, gore, etc.) or content intentionally designed to be offensive. We also ask that you do not use excessive vulgar language or profanity, and specifically ask that you avoid using slurs or racially charged language.

## 5. Keep chat clean

Do not spam emoji, bot commands, mentions, etc. Please try to use the chat channels appropriately.

# Minecraft rules

These rules apply both to the survival and creative servers.

## 6. Be considerate of other players

Be considerate of other members of the server. This includes asking for permission before building near another person, being aware of which farms are public and private, as well as repairing or reporting damage to builds.

You should also be considerate of server performance, large farms are allowed and encouraged, but you should do your best to minimize their impact on server performance.

## 7. Duping is prohibited

Do not duplicate items, this includes dragon eggs, sand, and concrete (which are able to be farmed on this server through other means). TNT entity duplication is specifically *allowed*.

## 8. Do not grief

Griefing can broadly be classified as intentionally preventing others from enjoying the game or ruining another's work. Please do not destroy builds, break farms, or steal items. You also may not build lag machines or take advantage of NBT overflow exploits (book banning / chunk banning).

## 9. Do not cheat or use illegal mods

Do not use mods or hacked clients which give you unreasonable abilities. This includes things like speed-hack, x-ray, or printer mods. You can find a specific list of mods which are disallowed [here](allowed-mods).

## 10. Do not abuse server features

Don't abuse server features, such as using freecam to look for ores or crashing the creative server with WorldEdit.

## 11. Report any exploits

Please responsibly report any exploits which you find on the server, this includes duplication exploits, methods of gaining OP or elevated permissions, methods of crashing the server, or others.

You can report an exploit by running `/apply` in any Discord channel and selecting the "Report" form.
