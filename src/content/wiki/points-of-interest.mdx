This is a collection of points of interest on the server, each entry will credit the Discord username of the person who built it, and will contain the coordinates, dimension, and status. The _public_ status means that you are free to take any drops produced by the farm. The _semi-public_ status means you can take only the specified drops. The _private_ status means you can only use the farm if you have direct permission.

# Farms

## Enderman XP farm

Directly behind the obsidian spawn platform in the end.
Important Notes: DO NOT place ANY blocks near the water. If you do, the water will update and destroy all of the carpets on the ground. The enderman will be able to hit you if you stand too close when hitting them I'm going to try to fix this later. Stand behind the slabs on the ground and attack if you don't want to take damage. Finally, please ask me before taking any of the endermen heads in storage. Thanks!

## Gold and bartering farm

Looting gold farm using a modified version of Gnembom's design. This is not free for anyone to use.

To change modes from storing to using for bartering, flick the lever in the center of the main room so that the redstone lamp turns on.
IMPORTANT:
DO NOT unload the farm while this system is running!
If you need to leave the game or are going to fly away, turn the lever off, then wait about 30 seconds.
After that you're free to do whatever.

Every stackable bartering item is currently sorted, and books are sorted out from all of the other unstackables. Currently, the enchanted books are not shulker loaded, so I'll need to add that soon.
