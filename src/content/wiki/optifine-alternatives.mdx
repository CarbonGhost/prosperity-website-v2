This is an exhastive list of all the mods you can use to replace OptiFine's functionality.

## Why ditch OptiFine?

OptiFine is a ubiquitous mod, and has been around for years. It's feature rich and, historically, has improved performance. However in recent years OptiFine's performance benefits have gotten smaller, and the mod now boasts list of bugs and drawbacks. OptiFine is known to replace large sections of vanilla code, and is now has years of technical debt, and this is all maintained by one person.

As stated above, OptiFine has a long list of issues, some of primary ones are:

- The mod breaks vanilla mechanics
- The mod updates slowly
- The mod has poor compatibility

Going through these point by point. OptiFine breaks vanilla mechanics with a few bugs, sometimes breaking world generation with fast math, as well as increasing player reach, bot to mention any rendering or stability issues that aren't present in vanilla.

OptiFine updates slowly, and Forge updates even slower, if you want to use the mod on the latest update, or in conjunction with other mods, you're likely to be waiting for awhile.

OptiFine has poor compatibility, this is a bigger issue, and not really something the mod can address. Without getting too technical, OptiFine is closed source, making fixing issues with other mods opaque to the end user; And unfortunately, this issue cannot be solved because of the way that OptiFine was developed.

### What about OptiFabric?

OptiFabric shares all of the same issues as OptiFine when run natively, along with a host of new incompatibilities and bugs. While this implementation of the mod is usable, I can't recommend that it be used.

## Your options

This list goes by feature and offers a list of mods to replace it, _all of these mods are tested and compatible unless otherwise stated_. This list is specifically targeted at Fabric, which is a preferable modloader to Forge. If you still wish to use Forge there is a brief section about it [here](#forge).

### Shaders & rendering

#### Shaders

**Iris** is a mod that intends to be fully compatible with OptiFine shaders while delivering great performance. You can see a list all the shaders I've tested in this Gist.

### Forge

Forge currently does not have a suitable OptiFine replacement, due to many incompatibilities with mods, I cannot recommend either OptiFine nor the [Halogen](https://www.curseforge.com/error?aspxerrorpath=/minecraft/mc-mods/halogen) mod (port of Sodium and Lithium).

## Why does this have to be so hard?

If you have taken the time to read through the suggestions here, or have compiled this list of mods yourself, you may be wondering why this has to be so difficult, when OptiFine can be installed in about 3 clicks. The answer is that there is no reason for it.

It is my personal opinion that, if ever OptiFine were to fall out of use, the Fabric modding community needs to make an option that is as appealing and easy to use for the average person as OptiFine currently is. The mods exist to replace the majority of the mods features, with equivalent or better results, the last obstacle is widespread adoption, and making the alternatives easy to use.
